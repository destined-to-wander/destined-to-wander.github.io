                        <h2>Early History</h2>
                        <p>
                            Fishing is one of humanity's oldest practices. Artifacts from the Upper Paleolithic such as
                            cave art, shell middens(a type of ancient waste pile), and the diet of the 40,000-year-old Tianyuan Man in China
                            show that early humans relied heavily on fish and seafood. 

                            At this point, humans began to fashion simple tools from bone and rock, 
                            and it's thought one of the first uses for these tools was to hunt down large fish. 
                            A dig at Daisy Cave, on San Miguel Island, uncovered bone fishhooks dating 8600-9600 years old.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The spear, net, line and rod seem to have appeared almost simultaneously in Egypt around 3500 BCE. 
                            Subsistence fishing changed little over the centuries and some techniques are still used today in recreational fishing in the West.

                        <h2>Fishing in Europe (circa 11th-15th century)</h2>
                        <p>
                            During the Middle Ages in Europe, feudal lords owned the rivers and lakes. 
                            River fishing was strictly regulated and permitted for people in religious 
                            communities whose diets were punctuated by periods of fasting. 
                            However, from the middle of the 11th century, the construction of ponds developed, 
                            heralding the beginning of fish farming.
                            <br><br>
                            From the 15th century, deep-sea fishing and the trade of fish expanded. 
                            The Dutch formed fleets of herring drifters which pulled a long drift net and 
                            could remain at sea for weeks at a time. They were supplied with provisions by 
                            ventjagers (cargo boats) which also brought the catch back to shore.

                        <h2>Deep-sea Fishing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Trawling first appeared in 17th century Britain, and expanded rapidly in the 
                            19th century after the introduction steam power. Boats became bigger and more powerful, 
                            enabling them to pull wide nets in deep water. The seafood trade intensified. 
                            The small English town of Grimsby became one of the major centres of 
                            commercial fishing in Europe and was connected by a direct railway line to 
                            London's Billingsgate Fish Market (the world's biggest fish market at that time).
                            <br><br>
                            As for recreational fishing, in the 18th century fly fishing was initially 
                            reserved for the wealthy classes. It gradually became more accessible as 
                            technological advances meant better equipment could be produced relatively 
                            cheaply. To satisfy anglers, non-native species were even introduced into 
                            certain regions, as was the case with trout in Australia.

                        <h2>Spearfishing</h2>
                        <p>
                            The spears used in fishing have evolvedas time passed.
                            Originally made from wood or cane, metal spears have become more commonplace.
                            Modern spearfishing commonly uses spearguns for propulsion
                            or Hawaiian slings as a simpler alternative. Divers often 
                            wear two-piece camouflage wetsuits, weight belts or vests for 
                            buoyancy control, and long fins designed for freediving efficiency. 
                            A snorkel and low-volume mask are standard, while gloves offer 
                            protection and warmth. Safety tools like knives or kill spikes 
                            are carried to dispatch fish humanely or in emergencies. Buoys 
                            and floatlines serve as both safety markers and tools for managing 
                            large fish, often displaying diver-down flags to alert boats. Fish 
                            stringers are used to store catches, and gear is often chosen for 
                            portability, camouflage, and effectiveness in various underwater conditions.

                        <h2>Fishing Tackle</h2>
                        <p>
                            Equipment used by anglers is commonly called fishing tackle, 
                            and includes items like hooks, lines, rods, reels, sinkers, floats, nets, 
                            lures, etc. Specific combinations of terminal tackle (tackle attached to the 
                            end of a line, like a fishing hook, opposed to say, a rod) may be called rigs.
                            <br><br>
                            Originating from a 14th-century Dutch word, "tackle" is often used in 
                            recreational contexts, as opposed to fishing gear, which 
                            commonly refers to commercial equipment. Core components include hooks, 
                            used since ancient times to catch fish by
                            impalement or snagging; lines, evolving from plant-based in construction
                            to modern synthetic fibers like nylon; and sinkers, which weigh down the 
                            bait, originally made of lead but now replaced due to toxicity. Fishing 
                            rods, used to cast and control lines, 
                            come in many types and materials, with reels allowing precise deployment 
                            and retrieval of line. Bait may be natural—like worms, insects, or fish—or 
                            artificial, such as plastic lures or electronic attractants. Finally, bite 
                            indicators like floats, quiver tips, or alarms help anglers detect fish 
                            activity at the hook. These components together form the essential toolkit 
                            for recreational fishing.

                        <h2>Trawling</h2>
                        <p>
                            Trawling is a commercial fishing method that involves dragging
                            a funnel-shaped net, called a trawl, through the water behind
                            one or more boats—referred to as trawlers or draggers. Trawlers 
                            range from small vessels to large factory ships, and trawling
                            can be done solo or cooperatively with two boats (pair 
                            trawling). Unlike recreational trolling, which uses rods and
                            lures, trawling employs large nets and is also used in
                            scientific surveys. There are two main types: bottom trawling,
                            which drags the net along the seafloor and can damage marine
                            habitats and release pollutants, and midwater (or pelagic)
                            trawling, which targets fish in the upper water column
                            and has a lower environmental impact. While bottom
                            trawling can contribute to habitat destruction and
                            greenhouse gas emissions, newer gear aims to reduce contact with the seabed. Midwater trawling, often used to catch species like mackerel and herring, reduces bycatch but still risks capturing non-target fish. Trawl nets are kept open using trawl doors or paired vessels, with floats and weights controlling vertical positioning. Gear varies widely depending on target species and depth, and trawls can be modified for environmental monitoring or research.

                        <h2>Overfishing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Overfishing is the excessive removal of fish from water bodies 
                            faster than they can naturally replenish, leading to declining 
                            populations, disrupted ecosystems, and long-term biodiversity 
                            loss. It affects all types of water bodies and causes resource 
                            depletion, reduced fish sizes, ecosystem imbalances, and even 
                            species extinction, as seen in cases like the Atlantic cod collapse 
                            and the extinction of the Chinese paddlefish. Driven by global demand, destructive fishing practices like bottom trawling and bycatch further exacerbate the damage. Overfishing reduces fishery productivity, threatens food security, and causes severe social and economic consequences, including the loss of billions in potential revenue. Mitigation involves regulation, sustainable practices, and raising consumer awareness, but continued overfishing remains a primary driver of oceanic species decline and ecosystem collapse worldwide.

                        <h2>Bottom Trawling</h2>
                        <p>
                            Bottom trawling causes significant environmental damage by physically disturbing the seafloor, overturning boulders, resuspending sediments, and leaving deep scars on the ocean bed. This repetitive activity degrades habitat quality, reduces biodiversity, and alters entire continental margins. Sensitive deep-sea organisms like corals are especially vulnerable, with 95% of seamount ecosystem damage attributed to trawling. Resuspended sediments from trawling introduce turbidity that affects light levels and kelp reproduction, remobilize toxins like PCBs and DDT into the food chain, and can create dead zones or harmful algal blooms. It also disrupts carbon and nutrient cycling, releasing an estimated 370 million tonnes of CO₂ annually, contributing to climate change. While some countries and regions have implemented trawling restrictions or bans, international waters largely lack regulation, making enforcement difficult. Despite efforts from nations like Palau and proposals for a global ban, a United Nations resolution failed to pass, leaving most of the ocean floor still vulnerable to this destructive practice.

                        <h2>Countermeasures</h2>
                        <p>
                            Countermeasures against overfishing include fisheries management, aquaculture, and marine reserves. Effective management sets quotas, limits gear, and can use rights-based systems like ITQs to promote sustainability. Gear changes—like using circle hooks—reduce bycatch and habitat damage. Ecosystem-based management looks at whole ecosystems instead of single species. Aquaculture provides alternative seafood sources but poses risks like escapes and overuse of wild fish for feed. Marine reserves protect biodiversity by restricting fishing, helping ecosystems recover. While these methods show promise, stronger global enforcement and adoption are needed to reverse marine decline.
